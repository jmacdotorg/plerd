=head1 NAME

plerdall - Publish an entire Plerd blog from source

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In /path/to/plerd/conf/plerd.conf:

 base_uri: http://blog.example.com path: /home/me/Dropbox/plerd title:
 My Lovely Blog

And then, on the command line, while in the top-level plerd directory:

 bin/plerdall

Oh, you don't have a Plerd blog at all yet? Then you can try this first:

 bin/plerdall --init=/home/me/Dropbox/plerd

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Run in its default mode, this program directs Plerd to completely
publish a blog, once, based configuration. If the blog's already been
published, then it'll get wholly and freshly republished.

This program can perform other one-off Plerd-related tasks, as well, as
directed by command-line options provided to it. See L<"OPTIONS">,
below.

For instructions on installing and using Plerd, please see the README
file that should have accompanied this distribution. It is also
available online at L<https://github.com/jmacdotorg/plerd#plerd>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 config

 bin/plerdall --config=/path/to/plerd.conf

Specify the location of a valid Plerd config file.

If not specified here, then this program will seek a config file in these
locations, and in this order:

=over

=item *

C<plerd.conf>, in the current working directory

=item *

C<conf/plerd.conf>, in the current working directory

=item *

C<.plerd>, in your home directory

=back

Consult the config file generated by C<plerdall --init> to learn more
about the config file format.

=head2 init

 bin/plerdall --init

 bin/plerdall --init=/path/to/new/plerd/directory

This command sets up a new working directory for a Plerd-powered blog.
It will contain default templates, workspaces, and config files.

If given a path, it will try to create the directory if one doesn't
already exist there. If the path already exists, plerdall will check
that it is an empty directory.

If not given a path, plerdall will default to C<./plerd>, and then
proceed as above.

This program will print either error text or a welcoming success message
with followup suggestions to STDOUT, and then exit. It will not perform
any blog publication beyond this initial setup.

=head2 send-webmentions

 bin/plerdall --send-webmentions

After publishing all the blog's posts, Plerd will then
direct every post to scan itself for hyperlinks and attempt to send
webmentions to each one.
